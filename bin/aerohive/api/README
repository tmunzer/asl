The main.js file is registering all the APIs from this library.

Currently, this library is not yet available on GitHub, but feel free to check the Aerohive repository to know if the work is done!


To use this library:
1. create a config.js file to put your App informations to get access to ACS (see config_example for more information)
2. import the main.js file to your project.
3. You will then be able to call all the API requests from this central point.

EXAMPLE:

var API = require(path_to_library + "/aerohive/api/main");
var xapi = {
  vpcUrl: "cloud-va.aerohive.com"       //the regional server
  ownerId: "00000",                     //the account "ownerId" value
  accessToken : "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"   //the Access Token to get data for this account
}
API.identity.userGroups.getUserGroups(xapi, null, null, function (err, result) {
  if (err) res.json({error: err});
  else {
    result.reqId = req.body.reqId;
    res.json(result);
  }
});
